# Snake & Ladder ‚Äì Interactive Web Game With New Features üéØ

### Project Description
This is a browser-based Snake & Ladder game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features a 10√ó10 board, two-player mode, and the classic snake and ladder rules with a twist ‚Äî landing on a snake triggers a fun dare.
The first player to reach tile 100 wins.

### The Problem 
People play Snake & Ladder, but simply sliding down a snake feels‚Ä¶ boring.
Clearly, humanity has been suffering from a severe lack of mandatory silly dares when bitten by snakes in board games.
This project heroically solves that by ensuring every snake encounter comes with an entertaining challenge ‚Äî because falling behind should at least make everyone laugh.

### The Solution 
We took the innocent, family-friendly Snake & Ladder game and supercharged it with chaos.
Now, whenever you land on a snake, you don‚Äôt just slide down ‚Äî you must complete a random dare, from singing terribly to doing five jumping jacks on the spot.
Because if you‚Äôre going to lose progress, you might as well lose your dignity too.
